1. conda activate env_name (need kernel from interpreter of this environment)
2. conda install ipykernel
2.1. conda activate base_env (an environment from which jupyter notebook starts)
3. python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name "Python (myenv)"
4. jupyter lab

notes:
if the step 3 performed in one environment but jupyter started from another it will not be able to start this kernel
install kernels from where usually start jupyter but than edit kernel json so it will pick needed interpreter
