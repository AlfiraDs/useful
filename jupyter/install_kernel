1. conda activate env_name
2. conda install ipykernel
3. python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name "Python (myenv)"
4. jupyter lab

tips:
if the step 3 performed in one environment but jupyter started from another it will not be able to start this kernel
install kernels from where usually start jupyter but than edit kernek json so it will pick needed interpreter
